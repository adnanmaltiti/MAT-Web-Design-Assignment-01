        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p>This is an initiative under the Awakening Muslimah. Our aim is to equip young women with modern technological skills. Train them to use these skills to solve society’s most pressing challenges and inspire others to join in contributing to the change process. Our IT skilled army of young women will take on the tech gender gap. We believe muslimah’s owe the world their contribution for the development and transformation of our world through technology. We also believe that every muslimah must play a part in creating the technology that will change the world.</p>
        <p>Our drive is passion, unity and purpose of team work which guides us on the path of achieving our goals. The trainers (volunteers) at MAT are dedicated to bringing you the best education and training.</p>

        <h3>Why Muslimah and Technology</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><p>The ICT sector is doing well, regardless of this gender imbalance. Technology is one of the primary drivers of the modern economy and a sector where productivity is rapidly increasing.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>An ICT workforce without women is bad for women. Women will be left behind economically. Women will be left out of some of the influential positions in industry and government due to lack of ICT skills and experience. Perhaps more importantly, diversity is good for business.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>A group with greater diversity solve complex problems better and faster than homogeneous groups do, and the presence of women in a group is more likely to increase the collective intelligence of the group.</p></li>
